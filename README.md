Translations, without any code, used by @GreenteaOS

## Thank you for your collaboration!

Note: the submissions will be under CC0-1.0 license by default without the "attribution" requirement to include the authors' copyright notice.

This means that author name (of the submission) is not required and is not guaranteed to be present in the credits.

We will probably automate the generation of the credits section from the git metadata, but overlap of the patches may also
override the autor name. Hopefully you're aware of and okay with this!

This is open for discussion on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/UGZq8GB) `#translators` room.
